# Data-Science-Projects
## Breast Cancer Prediction
This project implements machine learning models to classify breast tumors as either malignant or benign based on features extracted from digitized images of fine needle aspirates (FNA) of breast masses. The project includes both analysis scripts and an interactive web interface.

## Cardiovascular Disease Prediction
This project implements a Random Forest classifier to predict cardiovascular disease risk based on various patient health metrics. The project includes both analysis scripts and an interactive web interface with medical term explanations and profile comparison capabilities.
