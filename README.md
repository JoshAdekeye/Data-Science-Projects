# Data-Science-Projects
## Breast Cancer Prediction
This project implements machine learning models to classify breast tumors as either malignant or benign based on features extracted from digitized images of fine needle aspirates (FNA) of breast masses. The project includes both analysis scripts and an interactive web interface.

## Cardiovascular Disease Prediction
This project implements a Random Forest classifier to predict cardiovascular disease risk based on various patient health metrics. The project includes both analysis scripts and an interactive web interface with medical term explanations and profile comparison capabilities.

## Osteoporosis Risk Prediction
This project implements a machine learning model to predict osteoporosis risk based on various health factors and demographic information. Osteoporosis is a condition that weakens bones, making them fragile and more likely to break. It develops slowly over several years and is often only diagnosed when a minor fall or sudden impact causes a bone fracture. The model helps healthcare providers identify patients who may be at risk of developing osteoporosis, enabling early intervention and prevention strategies.

## Speech Emotion Analyzer
A deep learning model that detects emotions from speech using audio files. The model can:

- Detect emotions from audio files or live recordings
- Distinguish between male and female voices
- Classify emotions into categories: neutral, happy, sad, angry, and fearful
- Provide real-time analysis through a web interface
